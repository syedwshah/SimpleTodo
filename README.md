## Notes

It was great to learn how lightning fast it can be to build a front end with Android Studio. As someone who has been building mobile apps through JavaScript libraries/frameworks such as React-Native, it was a bit challenging at first to get acclimated with Java. Thankfully the tutorials were very easy to follow and my concerns became minor issues.
